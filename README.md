There are two seperate methods implemented on the dataset quora_duplicate_questions.tsv
1. 2_tf_idf_vec.py : Implements the TF-IDF method
2. 3_word2vec_train.py : Implements the Siamese Neural Network Method

The run results corresponding to both the methods are listed out in the corresponding LOGFILE


To run you'll need the Quora duplicate questions dataset and word2vec binfile. Download this from here:
